# Description
Molang insert is a simple tool that allows you to watch a JSON file and insert Molang expressions into it, based on a temporary ".molang" file. The goal is to make it easier to work with Minecraft's files that use Molang expressions that often need to be inserted into very long and unreadable strings.
